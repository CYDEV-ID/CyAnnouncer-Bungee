# Plugin Author: cydev-id
# Plugin Version: 1.7.0
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# This plugin will display announcements with an independent cycle for each server.
#
# 1. A server with specific messages (e.g., 'survival') will have a cycle of:
#    (Global Message -> Specific Survival Msg 1 -> Global Message -> ...)
#
# 2. A server WITHOUT specific messages will ONLY cycle through the global messages.
#
# ===================================================================

# Default interval in SECONDS between each announcement for a server.
interval: 60

# The prefix that appears before every line of an announcement.
# Set to "" (empty quotes) to disable the prefix entirely.
prefix: "&e[&l!&r&e] &r"

# --- ANNOUNCEMENTS SECTION ---
announcements:
  # --- GLOBAL ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # To make a message global, add "all" to its 'servers' list.
  - servers:
      - "all"
    lines:
      - "&eDon't forget to vote for the server every day!"
      - "&fUse the command &b/vote&f to get rewards."

  # --- SERVER-SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # These messages will ONLY be shown to players on the specified servers.

      - "survival"
